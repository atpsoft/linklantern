### summary
Warns you about recently created domains.

### description
Link Lantern automatically checks the age of every domain you visit and gives it an appropriate color: red less than 1 year old, yellow less than 3 years, or green if it's older.  The purpose is to warn you against phishing and malware sites which almost always use newly created domains.
